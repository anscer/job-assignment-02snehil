### Ideas for Improving Robot State Management
- Implement real-time state updates using WebSockets.
- Add more state properties like `priority`, `category`, and `tags` for better state categorization and filtering.
- Integrate with a logging system to track state changes and errors.

### Data Streaming and Error Communication
- Use a message broker like RabbitMQ or Kafka to stream data/logs from the robot to the application.
- Implement a notification system to alert users of critical errors or state changes.

### Additional State Properties
- `priority`: Helps in prioritizing state handling.
- `category`: Categorizes states into different types for better management.
- `tags`: Provides a flexible way to tag states with various labels.

### General Thoughts
- Focus on scalability and performance, especially when querying and aggregating state data.
- Implement efficient indexing and use aggregation pipelines in MongoDB for fast querying.
